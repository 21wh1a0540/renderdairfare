Airfare Trends Analysis:
Airfare Trends Analysis is a data-driven project that predicts airfare prices based on factors such as source, destination, date of journey, number of stops, and airline type from historical data.
The dataset was collected from Kaggle, and after thorough preprocessing, various machine learning models were tested. 
The Random Forest Regressor yielded the highest accuracy and was used as the final model. 
The project includes a web interface built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is deployed on the cloud via Render.
